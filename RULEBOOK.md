CENTRE FIVE POKER – TOURNAMENT RULEBOOK v1.1

1. GENERAL OVERVIEW
1.1 Game Summary
Centre Five Poker is a competitive draw-and-trade poker variant featuring a shared “Centre” hand that evolves during play and competes at showdown.
Players may Trade or Draw to improve their hands while influencing the Centre.
When the Centre reaches five cards, a Middle Call occurs and triggers the Final Action Round.
If a player Calls early, a Final Modification Round takes place before the Centre is completed and final betting begins.
If the Centre wins any portion of the pot, its share rolls over to the next hand.

1.2 Objective
Win chips by forming the highest-ranking five-card hand at showdown or by forcing all opponents to fold. Players must also beat the Centre hand.

1.3 Key Definitions
•	Centre Hand (Middle): A shared hand formed from Trades and Draw discards.
•	Trade: Swap exactly one card with the Centre (Centre size unchanged).
•	Draw: Draw a card and discard one face-up to the Centre (Centre size +1).
•	Player Call: A player declares that the hand should enter its final rounds.
•	Middle Call: Triggered automatically the moment the Centre reaches five cards.
•	Final Modification Round (FMR): A one-turn-per-player opportunity to modify hands after a Player Call.
•	Final Action Round (FAR): Betting phase where players choose Trade or Stay.

1.4 Components
•	Standard 52-card deck
•	Tournament chips
•	Dealer button

1.5 Players
2–6 players.

1.6 Betting Structure
Pot-Limit format with standard blinds.

2. THE CENTRE HAND (“CENTRE”)
2.1 Definition
A shared hand that grows through Draw discards and may be altered via Trades.

2.2 Starting State
After dealing five cards to each player, one burn card is placed face-down.
Two cards are dealt face-up to the Centre.

2.3 Maximum Size
The Centre can never exceed five cards.

2.4 Centre Participation
The Centre always participates at showdown. If a Player Call results in the Centre having fewer than five cards at the end of the Final Modification Round, the Centre is filled from the top of the deck until it reaches five cards, after which a Middle Call is executed. The Centre then participates normally in the Final Action Round and at showdown.

2.5 Ties with Players
Players split their portion of the pot; the Centre’s share rolls over.

2.6 Pot Rollover
If the Centre wins outright, the entire pot rolls over.
Rollover is uncapped.

5.4 Ending Phase 1
Phase 1 ends when either:
1.	Player Call: A player declares “Call” at the start of their turn, or
2.	Middle Call: The Centre naturally reaches five cards due to a Draw.

6. CALL ACTIONS & PHASE TRANSITIONS
Once a Call Action occurs, the game enters the Final Modification Round (FMR).

6.1 Player Call and start of the FMR (full modification allowed)
If a player Calls:
•	Each surviving player receives one turn.
•	They may Trade or Draw, provided the Centre has fewer than five cards.
•	If any Draw during FMR pushes the Centre to five cards then the Middle Call occurs instantly and FMR ends.

6.2 Completion of FMR After Player Call
If the full FMR completes and the Centre still has fewer than five cards:
•	The Centre is filled from the top of the deck until it reaches five cards.
•	A Middle Call is executed.

6.3 Middle Call signals Immediate End of Modification
Middle Call occurs the moment the Centre reaches five cards.
When Middle Call triggers:
•	No further Draws are allowed.
•	Remaining players in FMR may only Trade or take no action.

6.4 Middle Call Resolution
Once the Centre reaches five cards:
•	The Centre takes an automatic Stay-Check.
•	The Final Action Round begins with the next surviving player clockwise from the one who placed the Centre’s fifth card.

6.5 Player Call Resolution
If a Player Call initiated the Final Modification Round and the round completes without triggering a Middle Call, the Centre is filled to five cards:
•	The player who initiated the Call acts first in the Final Action Round.

7. PHASE 3 — FINAL ACTION ROUND (FAR)
7.1 Required Mode Selection

10. EXAMPLES OF PLAY
10.1 Example: Six-Player Hand with Early Player Call
This example demonstrates the complete interaction between a Player Call, the Final Modification Round (FMR), automatic Centre completion, Middle Call, and the start of the Final Action Round (FAR).
Setup
•	Six players are seated: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6.
•	Each player has been dealt five cards.
•	The Centre currently holds 2 cards.
•	Pre-modification betting has concluded with all six players still active.

Phase 1: Modification Phase
Player 1 (P1)
At the start of their turn, P1 declares “Call.”
This immediately ends the Modification Phase and begins the Final Modification Round (FMR).
Because the Centre has fewer than five cards, all players may Trade or Draw during FMR until a Middle Call occurs.

Phase 2: Final Modification Round (FMR)
Each surviving player receives exactly one turn, in clockwise order.
Player 2 (P2)
•	P2 chooses to Draw.
•	P2 draws a card, discards one face-up to the Centre.
•	Centre increases from 2 to 3 cards.
•	No Middle Call yet.
Player 3 (P3)
•	P3 also Draws.
•	Centre increases from 3 to 4 cards.
•	Still no Middle Call.
Player 4 (P4)
•	P4 chooses to Trade.
•	A Trade does not change Centre size.
•	Centre remains at 4 cards.
Player 5 (P5)
•	P5 chooses to Trade as well.
•	Centre remains at 4 cards.
Player 6 (P6)
•	P6 chooses to Trade again.
•	Centre remains at 4 cards.
The Final Modification Round is now complete.
The Centre has not reached five cards naturally.

Centre Completion After Player Call
Since the Player Call initiated the round and the Centre has fewer than five cards at the end of FMR:
•	The dealer fills the Centre from the top of the deck until it reaches five cards.
•	Centre goes from 4 to 5 cards.
Immediately upon reaching five cards, a Middle Call is executed.

Middle Call Resolution
When Middle Call occurs:
•	The Centre takes an automatic Stay-Check.
•	No further Draws are allowed for the rest of the hand.
•	All players proceed to the Final Action Round (FAR).
Determining the First Actor in FAR
Because this was a Player Call scenario, and the Final Modification Round completed normally (i.e., Middle Call did not occur mid-round):
→ Player 1 (P1), who initiated the Call, acts first in the Final Action Round.

Phase 3: Final Action Round (FAR)
P1 begins the round with the choice to:
•	Trade (swap one card with the Centre), or
•	Stay (keep current hand)
After choosing Trade or Stay, P1 may:
•	Check
•	Bet
•	Call (if facing a bet)
•	Raise
•	Fold
Action continues clockwise through P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6 following standard Pot-Limit procedure.
After betting concludes, all surviving players and the Centre proceed to showdown.

10.2 Example: Middle Call Triggered During FMR (Six Players)
This example demonstrates a Middle Call occurring before all players complete their Final Modification Round. It highlights how Draw actions can prematurely end FMR and immediately transition into the Final Action Round.
Setup
•	Six players remain active: P1 to P6.
•	Center starts with 3 cards.
•	P1 begins their turn and declares “Call.”
•	A Final Modification Round (FMR) begins.
Phase 2: Final Modification Round (FMR)
Player 2 (P2)
•	P2 chooses to Trade.
•	Center remains at 3 cards.
Player 3 (P3)
•	P3 chooses to Draw.
•	Center increases from 3 to 4 cards.
Player 4 (P4)
•	P4 chooses to Draw.
•	Center increases from 4 to 5 cards.
•	Middle Call is immediately triggered.
Because Middle Call has occurred, the FMR ends instantly.

Middle Call Resolution
•	No further Draws are permitted for the rest of the hand.
•	Remaining players in the FMR (P5 and P6) may only Trade or take no action.
•	The Center takes an automatic Stay-Check.
•	The Final Action Round begins with the next surviving player clockwise from P4 (the player who placed the fifth Center card).
Thus, P5 acts first in the Final Action Round.

Phase 3: Final Action Round (FAR)
•	P5 chooses Trade or Stay, then checks/bets/raises/folds.
•	Action proceeds through P6, P1, P2, P3, and P4.
•	After betting, remaining players and the Center proceed to showdown.

10.3 Example: Middle Call Triggered During Phase 1
This example shows a Middle Call occurring before any Player Call, ending the Modification Phase immediately and skipping the Final Modification Round entirely.
Setup
•	Six players (P1–P6) are active.
•	Pre-modification betting has concluded.
•	Center starts with 4 cards.
•	It is P3’s turn during the Modification Phase.

Phase 1: Modification Phase
Player 3 (P3)
•	P3 chooses to Draw.
•	Center increases from 4 to 5 cards.
•	Middle Call is immediately triggered.
This ends Phase 1 instantly.

Phase 2: No Final Modification Round
Because Middle Call was triggered during Phase 1:
•	There is no Final Modification Round.
•	All players proceed directly to the Final Action Round (FAR).
•	The Center takes an automatic Stay-Check.
•	Draws are no longer permitted.
Determining First To Act in FAR
Since P3 placed the fifth card into the Center:
→ P4 acts first in the Final Action Round.

Phase 3: Final Action Round
•	Each player chooses Trade or Stay
•	Betting proceeds in Pot-Limit format
•	Surviving players and the Center go to showdown

10.4 Example: Player Call, FMR, and Middle Call Occur With Only One Draw
This example demonstrates a Player Call where the Center is already near completion, and the FMR ends quickly due to a single Draw pushing the Center to five cards.
Setup
•	Six players (P1–P6).
•	Center has 4 cards at the moment P1 begins their turn.
Player 1 (P1)
•	P1 declares “Call.”
•	FMR begins.
•	Because Center has 4 cards, Draws are still permitted (until Middle Call).

Phase 2: Final Modification Round
Player 2 (P2)
•	P2 chooses to Draw.
•	Center increases from 4 to 5 cards.
•	Middle Call is immediately triggered.
•	FMR ends instantly.
No other players (P3–P6) receive modification turns.

Middle Call Resolution
•	Center takes an automatic Stay-Check.
•	No further Draws allowed.
•	The Final Action Round begins with the next surviving player clockwise from P2.
Thus, P3 acts first in the Final Action Round.

Phase 3: Final Action Round
•	Each player chooses Trade or Stay
•	Betting occurs normally under Pot-Limit rules
•	Surviving hands and Center go to showdown
