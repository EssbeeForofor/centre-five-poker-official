Centre Five Poker
A Competitive Draw-and-Trade Poker Variant Featuring a Living Centre Hand

Official Repository – Rulebook v1.1

Centre Five Poker is a newly designed poker variant centred around a dynamic Centre Hand that evolves during play and competes at showdown.
Players strategically Trade or Draw to shape both their own hands and the Centre, influencing the flow and outcome of every round.

When the Centre reaches five cards, a Middle Call is triggered automatically, leading to a tense Final Action Round.
If the Centre wins any portion of the pot, its share rolls over into the next hand—creating dramatic momentum and unique tournament dynamics.

Core Concepts
Players receive 5 cards each.
The Centre begins with 2 face-up cards.

Players may:
Trade (swap one card with the Centre)
Draw (take a new card and discard one to the Centre)

A Player Call initiates controlled final modification.
A Middle Call occurs automatically when the Centre reaches 5 cards.
The Centre always joins the showdown.
Centre wins = pot rollover to the next hand.
